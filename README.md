# checker_board
a quick page to help me organize my infosec links and processes.

I'll try to remember to update it here when I make changes.

I also owe a better description here.  

27 Mar figured out a better way to get the time to present that didn't need all that extra code.  
  also changed the green from dark to light.  Gonna see how that goes on my eyes.  May change it back later.

30 Mar - figured out I should comment the new commits - learning github.
